              <br> In the vast waters of a magical world, where the essence of water, fire, and earth intertwined in harmony, an ancient legend unfolded. In this mystical realm, three individuals emerged, each bestowed with extraordinary powers that mirrored the elements themselves.</p>
        </br> Florna, tall with her dark skin and a heart as rich as the earth itself, was a 25-year-old wielder of earth magic. She possessed the ability to turn every dead thing into something beautiful, coaxing flowers to bloom and trees to flourish with but a touch of her hand. Standing alongside her is Sean. He is tall, a 30-year-old master of water magic. With his commanding presence and calm demeanor, Sean had the power to control the oceans and seas, manipulating water to freeze, boil, and move in any shape or direction he desired. Completing the trio is Flare, a fiery 20-year-old with a spirit as fierce as the flames she commanded. Tall and graceful, she could conjure fire at will, shaping it into blazing infernos or delicate fire sculptures with a mere thought.
<br> One day, the silence of the cosmos is suddenly shattered by a brilliant streak of fiery light hurtling through the void. An asteroid, ablaze with flames, races towards Earth with frightening speed, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Against the backdrop of the inky blackness, the asteroid glows with an otherworldly radiance, casting an eerie glow across the cosmic canvas. Its surface is aglow with molten hues of red and orange as it barrels towards its inevitable collision with Earth. In the distance, other planets hang suspended in the velvet embrace of space, their serene beauty juxtaposed against the impending chaos. The sight is both breathtaking and terrifying, a reminder of the raw power and unfathomable vastness of the universe. As the asteroid draws closer to Earth, its fiery descent intensifies, casting long shadows across the desolate landscape below. The air crackles with electricity as the ground trembles in anticipation of the cataclysmic impact. Amidst the chaos, stars twinkle defiantly against the backdrop of the impending disaster, their distant light offering a glimmer of hope in the face of impending destruction. But against the unstoppable force of nature, their brilliance is but a fleeting reminder of the fragility of life in the vastness of the cosmos.
